# FM Synthesizer #

## Wishlist ##
* velocity sensitivity control
* LFO tempo sync
* aftertouch
* transpose knob
* Mono legato mode
  * portamento
  * note priority
* Phase control per operator

## Bugs ##
* Click at the end of notes getting cut off, if the amplitudes are
  significantly different.
* make undo/redo work, possibly without buying a commercial license for
  PluginParameters
* voice stealing: prefer to steal unheld notes before held?
